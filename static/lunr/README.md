# How to use Lunr search

Lunr works out of the box and needs any coniguration.

If you desire to add supporto for your own language copy/paste `lunr.it.js` and rename it accordingly to your own language (`lunr.fr.js`, `lunr.de.js`, etc.) then translate it.

Copy on your server directory ONLY the file for your own language just translated.
