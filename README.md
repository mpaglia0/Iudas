# This is **Z** (a privacy focused Pelican theme)

Initially inspired by [Clean Blog layout](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog).

:warning: **Needs at least [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) ver. 4.0** (*tested till ver. 4.9.1*)

**Z** was initially inspired by Clean Blog layout but now it is following a complete separate developing roadmap.

## Some details...

- HTML5 tags

- Designed with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) (Bootstrap version can be found in ``static/bootstrap`` folder)

- Customized Bootstrap CSS build from Sass sources at compile time and served locally (no more via CDN)

- Bootstrap icons

- No jQuery dependencies

- Content Security Policy ([CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)).

- All main browsers versions are supported except Internet Explorer that is no more supported in any of its versions!

## More privacy, more security

**Z** is developed with Privacy as a main target.

Starting from **Z v.3.0** Security has also been kept in great account.

In the repo you can find a sample of ``.htaccess`` file with some suggestions about safe server configuration parameters.

:warning: This file has to be considered as a simple suggestion only. NEVER apply any line of code if you do not know what you are exactly doing!

Starting from **Z v3.1** [Mosparo](https://mosparo.io/) spam detection has been integrated.

## Highlights

### Changed font

Changed the original *Open Sans* font with Bootstrap 5 native fonts.

### Contact Form

A Contact Form template is available in the ``template`` directory.

You can use it including the HTML code in a customized page.

:warning: needs a PHP capable hosting! PHP code is available in the ``static`` directory.

Starting from **Z v2.03** the Contact Form includes a simple SPAM filter based on a honeypot trick.

Starting from **Z v3.1** [Mosparo](https://mosparo.io/) spam detection has been integrated.

### Integration of Series plugin

In order to use the [Series](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/series) plugin simply enter a ``:series:`` (reST) or ``Series:`` (Markdown) metadata in your article.

More information about how to configure your template are available on the plugin repository.

### Website Search

[**Tipue Search**](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/tipue-search) is a no more active project so I have forked it and created [**Lunr-search**](https://github.com/mpaglia0/Lunr-search) a plugin that produces a JSON file suitable to be used with [**Lunr.js**](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js).

Lunr structure is available inside the theme and can work out of the box.

### Static Comments Plus

**For ethical/privacy reasons DISQUS comment system has been removed**.

[**Static Comments Plus**](https://github.com/mpaglia0/Static_Comments_Plus) has been hacked from [Static Comments](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/static_comments) plugin and has the following improvements:

- Added a ``STATIC_COMMENTS_SOURCE`` parameter in order to choose if comments have to be written in *Markdown* or *reST* format.

- Added a PHP script (available in the ``static`` directory) that will allow visitors to send comments through the form (Static Comments needs you send the comment by email).

:warning: Each article needs to have the ``slug`` metadata duly assigned in order to let this plugin works!

Starting from **Z v2.03** the Comment Form includes a simple SPAM filter based on a honeypot trick.

Starting from **Z v3.1** [Mosparo](https://mosparo.io/) spam detection has been integrated.

### Read time

A function that calculates and shows the approx. read time for articles has been added using the [Readtime](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/readtime) plugin.

![Screenshot](screenshots/readtime.jpg)

### Share buttons

**Removed AddThis for ethical/privacy reasons**.

For privacy reason since **Z v3.0** the [AddThis](https://www.addthis.com/) service has been dropped in favour of the [**share-post**](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/share-post) plugin.

In this occasion support for [share post on Mastodon](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/share-post/commit/89d1f123e8094245d11aaceb926ab05fffcac430) has been added to that plugin.

### Post on Mastodon

Always in view of more privacy and freedom a new plugin has been developed. It is called [**Pelican-fediverse**](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/fediverse) and can publish automatically new contents of your website on Mastodon.

### Sensitive contents

**Z** takes also care for people respect!

Adding to an image the CSS class ``img-blurred`` you will obtain a blurred (semi-visible) image.

Hovering the mouse cursor over the blurred image will show it completely (without the blur filter).

You can also advise people with a dedicated advice!

The CSS class ``sensitive`` is available for this step and will render a white-on-black text.

The final result will be the following.

### Courses/Lessons

Starting from **Z v3.0** you can organize online courses/lessons!

Base document is *article* (so you can benefit from all plus of articles like read time and comments).

An article will became a lesson adding the following metadata keys:

reST

```rst
:course: <course_title>
:series: <course_title>
:series_index: <order_of_lessons_starting_from_1>
```

Markdown

```markdown
course: <course_title>
series: <course_title>
series_index: <order_of_lessons_starting_from_1>
```

Explanation:

**Course** key simply tells Jinja2 this document is not a standard article but a course lesson. The content of this key is not [yet] managed but I suggest to use the name (title) of the course. IF *course* is NOT empty Jinja2 will compile that page as a *lesson* instead of a normal *article* i.e.

1. changes navigation button labels from *chapter* into *lesson* and

2. builds an offcanvas index allowing navigation among lessons.

**Series** is simply used to actually manage the course/lessons (title, index, etc.).

**Series_index** forces lessons order. [Series](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/series) plugin orders items (lessons, in our specific case) using the creation date, but it could happen you have to insert a lesson between two existing ones. In this case *creation dates* cannot be used since the latest lesson you wrote will be listed at the end of your index. 

To force the order you want, you have to use the *series_index* key. Enter 1, 2, 3, etc. in each of your articles and [Series](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/series) will order items following entered numbers and not creation dates.

# Basic theme configuration

### All following configuration parameters are valid only for **Z** theme.

Properties have to be entered in ``pelicanconf.py``. For your convenience, you can find a ``pelicanconf.py`` template in this repo. You can look here in order to have a nice starting point.

### Header image Covers

To define custom header cover, set the property ``HEADER_COVER``:

```python
HEADER_COVER = 'enter/your/path/my_image.png'
```

### Header Color

To define a simple header background color, set the property ``HEADER_COLOR``:

```python
HEADER_COLOR = 'black'
```

You can use any valid CSS color definition.

### Social URLs

For Github, Twitter and other URLs set these properties:

```python
SOCIAL = (('twitter', 'https://twitter.com/myprofile'),
          ('github', 'https://github.com/myprofile'),
          ('facebook','https://facebook.com/myprofile'),
          ('flickr','https://www.flickr.com/myprofile/'),
    	  ('mail','mailto:your@email.address'))
```

If you plan to use the Contact Module and you think to add its relevant icon among the Social ones, you could enter:

```python
SOCIAL = (('mail', 'https://your-domain/your-contact-module'))
```

If you have more links add them to SOCIAL. The 'Name' has to be the name of the corresponding Bootstrap icon.
If ``SHOW_SOCIAL_ON_INDEX_PAGE_HEADER`` is set to ``True`` social icons will be
shown under site sub-title on the index page.

### External feed URL

You can specify an external feed URL (e.g. FeedBurner) in ``SOCIAL`` using the
``rss`` or ``rss-fill`` icons. The icon will be shown in the footer with the
rest of your ``SOCIAL`` accounts. A ``<link>`` tag for the external feed will be
placed in ``<head>`` instead of the default Pelican feeds.

### Single author

Pelican has been designed for a multi-author site.

Clicking on each author name will redirected the visitor to a page containing all articles published by the selected author.
If you are the only one writing on your own blog, this behaviour causes a boring loop since all articles belong, obviously, only to you...

To avoid this set

```python
AUTHOR_URL = ''
AUTHOR_SAVE_AS = ''
AUTHORS_SAVE_AS = ''
```

so authors pages are not created on build time, and then

```python
SINGLE_AUTHOR_SAVE_AS = 'your-static-presentation-page/index.html'
```

in order to build a single static page dedicated to you.

### Back-To-Top button

This feature has been removed since ver. 2.0 of **Z** since now a more comfortable fixed-top menu bar is used.

### Code highlights

This theme contains this color schemes:

 - Tomorrow - ``tomorrow.css``;
 - Tomorrow Night - ``tomorrow_night.css``;
 - Monokai - ``monokai.css``;
 - Github - ``github.css``;
 - Github Jekyll (Gray BG Jekyll way) - ``github_jekyll.css``;
 - Darkly (Default) - ``darkly.css``;

To customize, define ``COLOR_SCHEME_CSS`` with CSS filename.

Example:

```python
COLOR_SCHEME_CSS = 'monokai.css'
```

### User defined CSS

Define ``CSS_OVERRIDE`` to insert a user defined CSS file after theme CSS.

Example:

```python
CSS_OVERRIDE = 'enter/your/path/myblog.css'
```

### Customized theme JavaScript

Set ``ENABLE_CUSTOM_THEME_JAVASCRIPT`` to ``True`` if you want to use
your own JavaScript.

In the ``base.html`` template scroll to the bottom of the page and find this piece of code

```python
{% if ENABLE_CUSTOM_THEME_JAVASCRIPT %}
   <!-- Custom Theme JavaScript -->
   {% assets filters="rjsmin", output="js/your_own_javascript.min.js", "js/your_own_javascript.js" %}
      <script src="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ ASSET_URL }}"></script>
   {% endassets %}
{% endif %}
```
Set here the name of our own javascript and you are served.

Starting from **Z ver. 2.0** ``Z.js`` has been completely removed but this feature
has been kept in order to let you use your own JavaScript (if needed).

### User defined footer

Define ``FOOTER_INCLUDE`` to insert a custom footer text
instead of the default "Powered by Pelican". The value is a template path. You also
need to define the ``EXTRA_TEMPLATES_PATHS`` setting. If your custom footer
template is stored under the content ``PATH`` then Pelican will try to render
it as regular HTML page and will most likely fail. To prevent Pelican from
trying to render your custom footer add it to ``IGNORE_FILES``.

Example:

```python
FOOTER_INCLUDE = 'myfooter.html'
IGNORE_FILES = [FOOTER_INCLUDE]
THEME_TEMPLATES_OVERRIDE = [os.path.dirname(__file__)]
```

:warning: Avoid using names which duplicate existing templates from the
theme directory, for example ``footer.html``. Due to how Pelican searches the
template directories it will first find the files in the theme directory and you
will not see the desired results.

### Dynamic Copyright year

Enter a ``COPY_DATE`` value if you need a static Copyright year.

If you need a dynamic Copyright year (i.e. the current year) proceed in this way:

1. At the beginning of your ``pelicanconf.py`` enter the Python function ``from datetime import date``
2. Then set ``DCOPY_DATE`` with value ``date.today().year``. This will return the current year.

You can use the static or the dynamic year or also both, like in the following example:

```python
COPY_DATE = '2015 -'
DCOPY_DATE = date.today().year
```

Will return -> **2015 - 2021**

### Analytics

**Removed Google Analytics for ethical/privacy reasons**.

Kept only the free [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) (aka Piwik) system.

:warning: needs new Matomo > 4.0

 On ``publishconf.py`` set ``ACTIVATE_MATOMO`` to ``True``

:warning: starting from **Z v3.0** the Matomo integration has changed in order to be CSP compliant. The ``analytics.html`` page has been removed from ``templates`` and a ``matomo-tracking.js`` file has been added in ``static/js``.

### Favicon

To define if using a favicon and its format:

```python
FAVICON = 'favicon.ico'
```

:warning: It is necessary ``STATIC_PATHS`` configured!

```python
STATIC_PATHS = ['images', 'extra/favicon.ico']
EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {
    'extra/favicon.ico': {'path': 'favicon.ico'}
}
```

### CSS and JavaScript minification

:warning: [Webasset](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/webassets) plugin needed!

Minfication of CSS and JavaScripts is managed with the Webasset plugin, so this is a **REQUIRED** plugin.

Minification with Webasset comes fully configured. For more information you can visit the [plugin repo](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/webassets) or the [webasset documentation](https://webassets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Other configuration parameters

 - If ``SHOW_SHARE_BUTTONS`` is set to ``True``, sharing buttons will appear at the bottom of the article (needs [share-post](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/share-post) plugin);
 - ``GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION`` - Google site verification token;
 - ``BING_SITE_VERIFICATION`` - Bing site verification token;
 - Set ``SHOW_FULL_ARTICLE`` to ``True`` to show full article content on index.html instead of summary;
 - Set ``SHOW_SITESUBTITLE_IN_HTML`` to ``True`` to make use of the ``SITESUBTITLE`` variable inside the ``<title>`` HTML tag;
 - Set ``FACEBOOK_ADMINS`` to a list of Facebook account IDs which are associated with this blog. For example ``['12345']``. For more info see
 https://developers.facebook.com/docs/platforminsights/domains

### Translation for templates strings

A gettext method has been used. This is a good method if you have only a few strings to be translated (this is the case for templates).

Create a text file in your website root directory and rename it - for example - ``myfunctions.py``. Fill this file with the following instruction:

```python
# custom Jinja2 filter for localizing theme
def gettext(string, lang):
    if lang == "en":
        return string
    elif lang == "it":
        if string == "Archives": return "Archivi"
        elif string == "Archives for": return "Archivi per"
	elif string == "Posted by": return "Pubblicato da"
        ...
	...
        else: return string
```
Now you have to call it at the end of your ``pelicanconf.py`` in this way:

```python
import myfunctions
JINJA_FILTERS = {
     'gettext': myfunctions.gettext,
}
```

:warning: This method translates only template stings! Translating content is fully explained in Pelican documentation.

### Articles in deep

 - To customize header cover in articles, insert the metadata ``header_cover``.
 - To customize OpenGraph images, insert the metadata ``og_image``, otherwise ``header_cover``, ``HEADER_COVER`` or a default image is used.
 - To customize Twitter card images, insert the metadata ``twitter_image``, otherwise ``header_cover``, ``HEADER_COVER`` or a default image is used.

Twitter cards are automatically generated if the ``twitter`` icon is configured in ``SOCIAL``!
 
Since OpenGraph images and Twitter images have different dimensions, and you do not want them to be cut by social engines, two example templates are available in the ```static/images``` directory.

All image paths are relative to the site root directory!

You can also use absolute URLs for ``og_image`` and ``twitter_image``.

Other metadata can be created to assign resume of article, with ``headline``:

 - reST

```rst
My title
========

:date: 2010-10-03 10:20
:modified: 2010-10-04 18:40
:tags: tag1, tag2
:category: yeah
:slug: my-post
:authors: Spiderman, Conan Doyle
:summary: Short version for index and feeds
:headline: Resume of article
```
